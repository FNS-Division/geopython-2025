## Overview

This repository contains links to slides hosted on a [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-4AfC8c9T6JMUHEtFtCyKlLG3kGGERIL?usp=sharing) and Jupyter notebooks for a workshop on infrastructure mapping and analysis. The workshop covers an introduction to GIS systems, data standardization, visualization, coverage analysis, fiber path modeling, and cost estimation.

## Training agenda

- **Slides:**
    - [`ITU broadband connectivity planning tools`](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11Zyl1DhpP4KbRYcbHlPyPV0w-fLUyDur/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=110166480978407115454&rtpof=true&sd=true): Overview of ITU connectivity planning tools for schools

- **Jupyter Notebooks:**
    - [`0_get_open_data.ipynb`](0_get_open_data.ipynb): Get open data on ICT infrastructure and standardize it
    - [`1_proximity_coverage_demand.ipynb`](1_proximity_coverage_demand.ipynb): Analysis of coverage proximity and demand mapping
    - [`2_visibility_analysis.ipynb`](2_visibility_analysis.ipynb): Visibility and line-of-sight analysis for network planning
    - [`3_fiber_modeling.ipynb`](3_fiber_modeling.ipynb): Fiber network modeling and optimization
    - [`4_cost_modelling.ipynb`](4_cost_modelling.ipynb): Cost estimation and financial modeling

## Pre-requisites

To run the Jupyter notebooks on **Google Colab**, you'll need:
- A Google account (e.g. a Gmail account).

To run these notebooks **locally**, you'll need:

- Python 3.9
- Jupyter Notebook/Lab

## Setup instructions

### To run notebooks locally

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FNS-Division/geopython-2025.git
cd geopython-2025
```

2. Create and activate the Conda environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate inframaptraining
```

3. Launch Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

### To run notebooks on Google Colab

All notebooks are created using Google Colab for easy accessibility. In order to run them on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), you will need to sign in with a Google account. If you are unfamiliar with Google Colab, please watch this [introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI).

1. Navigate to each notebook in the repository
2. At the top of each notebook, click on the **Open in Colab** button.
